# Custom-theme-wordpress-development-guidelines

## Custom Coding
1. Prefix all functions with clientcode_ and tables with a unique white_label prefix.
2. Provide comments for functions and templates.
- describe what the function does and why you are using it
- comment template headers by telling us what the template does and why you are using it
3. Declare varibles at the top of the file where possible
